<h1 class="recipies">Breakfast</h1>

<div class="mealinfo">
    <p>The meal eaten in the morning. The English term refers to breaking the overnight
        fasting period. Traditions of eating morning meals have existed since ancient times, though it wasn't 
        until the 15th century that breakfast became used in written English. In medieval Europe, breakfast was 
    considered a luxury for the rich, only a necessity for laborers, or most often skipped. 
    American colonists would eat breakfast but only after a few hours of morning work. Historians agree that 
breakfast became routine in the morning <em>before work</em> when workers moved to cities and became employees with set schedules.
